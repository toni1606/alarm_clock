# Alarm Clock
As the name suggests this is a alarm clock, made in rust. You can specify the time using the arguments `-h` for hour `-m` for minute and `-p` for pm (if not set defaults to am)
The original idea came from https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerprojects/comments/4n9hne/project_idea_alarm_clock/
